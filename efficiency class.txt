    Find the food f in todo of maximum protein.             log(n)           
    Remove f from todo.                                     1(n)
    Let c be f’s calories.                                  1(n)

lim  6n + log(n) + 3 = 3 + log(n) + 0
x->∞

answer = O(n log(n))

The longest part of this is the sorting algorithm used to 
sort from most to least protein. Time for merge sort 
is n log n
